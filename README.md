Title: Integration and Multi-objective Optimization of Green Energy Island based on Artificial Intelligence
Version: Edward Xu, 7th May, 2018, Chongqing University, China.

Hi, everyone, my name is Edward Xu. This is my undergraduate project. Welcome you to look at it and discuss with me.

I am currently studying sustainable energy in Chongqing University, but I am going to Denmark Technical University to continue my graduate program - energy system analysis. I would like to share with you my learning.

## Introduction
We are facing more and more urgent energy-economy-environment problems. The past experience has indicated that the centralized energy systems are out of date in todayâ€™s planet because of low-efficiency, energy waste and high-risk. Green Energy Island has been proposed to replace them, which integrates several energy technologies and are able to track the fluctuation of energy demand to save primary energy. However, only by careful design and optimization can we build the qualified Green Energy Island to improve thermodynamic and economic efficiency and avoid strict energy management in unusual conditions. The techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI) can make a difference in this task. Through this research task, I will go over the past knowledge, become familiar with academic research, and more energetic to continue study life in energy system analysis.
