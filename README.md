Simulation and Optimization of Static Distributed Energy System

## Introduction

`StaticDESim` is a series of models for thermal engines, heat transfers and thermal facilities in rated condition. It can help design and optimize distributed energy system to provide electricity, heating and cooling.

## Basic Structure

The object is a grid-connected distributed energy system, called Green Energy Island (GEI), composed of a variety of energy technologies. It satisfies the need of people and equipments in a remote island by supplying electricity, hot steam, and cooling. There are three facilities, Micro Gas Turbine (MGT), Aqueous Lithium-Bromine Single-Effect Absorption Chiller (AC_ALB), and R123 Organic Recycle Cycle (ORC_R123), providing the majority of three products. Nature gas or other substituted fuel burns in MGT to produce electricity, with waste heat recovered by AC_ALB and ORC_R134a. One produces cool water, and the other one produces electricity. There is also energy from the sun collected through Photovoltaic Modules (PV) and Concentrating Solar Thermal Collector (CST). PV can produce electricity, and CST can produce hot steam. Electricity can also be generated by Wind Turbine (WT). Besides, if the load of hot steam and cooling canâ€™t be met, Heat Pump (HP) and R134a Vapor Compression Chiller (VCC_R134a) can be powered to supply hot steam and cooling, respectively. If the electricity generated is consumed to supply other products, it can be bought from National Grid (NG). The overall illustration of the system is shown as.
